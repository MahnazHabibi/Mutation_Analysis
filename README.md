# Mutation_Analysis

Unsupervised machine learning method to identify candidate driver genes.

Descripotion:

This repository contains the data and MATLAB code for the "A new machine learning method for cancer mutation analysis":

Data sets:

File "" contains 1,374 informative biological processes related to COVID-19 that are published on the Gene Ontology.

File "Disease_Cases.mat" is the MATLAB .mat file contains the list of 15 diseases which are analized and the list of their cases.

File "" is the MATLAB that contains informative features for 20,040 proteins from inputs related to COVID-19

To run an algorithm "Topological_feature.m".

To run three machine learning algorithms follow the "Read_me.txt" steps.
