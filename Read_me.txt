# A method to construct mutation network and calculate topological features.
Version 1.0

To construct mutation network, find the informative features and calculate Laplacian Score for each feature in a new dataset, please prepare your input as the MATLAB .mat file in the following format:

Gene = 

  1Ã—n struct array with fields:

    gene: Contains the list of n cancer mutated genes
    case: Contains the list of cases



for example:
Gene(1).gene='TP53'
Gene(1).case= {'TCGA-37-5819' , 'TCGA-37-A5EL' , 'TCGA-37-A5EM' , 'TCGA-37-A5EN'}

You can use "Genes_Cases.mat" file contains 573 cancer mutated genes and their related cases.

==============

The entry point of the code is "Topological_Feature.m"
To run the "Topological_Feature.m", use the following arguments in MATLAB command line:

"[Feature_Matrix,LS]=Topological_Feature(Gene)"



The output contain two MATLAB files:

Feature_Matrix : each array of feature matrix  x_{ij} represents and the j-th feature of the i-th genes.

LS  :  The Laplacian Score for each feature.

# An unsupervised machine learning method to calculate Laplacian Score for each cancer mutated gene.
Version 1.0

To calculate the Laplacian Score values in a new dataset, please prepare your input as the MATLAB .mat file.

The entry point of the code is "LSFS.m"
To run the "LSFS.m", use the following arguments in MATLAB command line:

"[LS] = LSFS(X,Epsilon,threshold)"


X represents the feature matrix.

Epsilon and threshold values between 0 to 100.
 
The output "LS" contains the Laplacian Score for each feature.
